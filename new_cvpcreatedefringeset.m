% function out_struct = cvpcreatedefringeset(imagestack, mask, pca_number)
% 
% This function creates a defringe set from a stack of images.  The
% defringe set is a set of images that can be used to remove fringes from
% images.  The defringe set is created by taking the PCA of the image
% stack.  The PCA is only performed on the pixels that are not masked out
% by the mask.  The mask is a 4 element vector that specifies the top,
% bottom, left, and right of the mask. pca_number specifies the number of
% PCA vectors to keep for the defringe set.  The output is a structure 
% with two fields.  The first field is the defringe set.  The second field
% is a sparse matrix that can be used to mask out the pixels that are not
% in the mask.
